## **üïπ Direct Deployment**

1.Login to your [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).

2.Navigate to "Workers & Pages" > "Create" and create new worker.

3.Copy the content of [worker.js](https://github.com/lawdakacoder/FileShareBot/blob/main/worker.js) file.

4.Paste the code in worker's code editor and fill following variables then click deploy button:
  * **SECRET_TOKEN**: Random long url safe token to protect unauthorized execution of your Cloudflare worker.

      * Send `/secret 32` command to [DumpJsonBot](https://t.me/DumpJsonBot) to generate it.

      * Alternatively, it can be manually created by using alphabets, numbers and by not using any special character except `_` and `-`.

  * **BOT_TOKEN**: API token of your Telegram bot, can be obtained from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

  * **BOT_USERNAME**: Username of your Telegram bot without '@'.

  * **CHANNEL_ID**: ID of channel where bot will save user files, this can be obtained by adding [DumpJsonBot](https://t.me/DumpJsonBot) in your channel and by sending `/chat`.

  * **ADMIN_IDS**: List of user ids that can ban and unban users, user id can be obtained by sending `/chat` to [DumpJsonBot](https://t.me/DumpJsonBot).

  * **DISABLE_FORWARDS**: Restrict user from forwarding or copying files provided by bot.

5.Navigate to "Workers & Pages" (drop-down menu) > "KV" > "Create a namespace" and create two namespaces called `users` and `msgs_keys`.

6.Go back to Worker (created in 2nd step) > "Settings" > "Variables" > scroll down to "KV Namespace Bindings" and create two variables `users` and `msgs_keys` and bind them to same namespaces (created in 5th step) > "Deploy".

7.Copy your worker's URL and set webhook as given [here](#webhook).

>[!TIP]
> If you‚Äôre already using my [ContactBot](https://github.com/lawdakacoder/ContactBot), there‚Äôs no need to create a separate `users` namespace. You can simply bind the existing one to your worker. This will ban the user in another bot with same reason automatically.
